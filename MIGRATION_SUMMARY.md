# Backend Separation - Migration Summary

## What Has Been Completed

### ✅ Backend Infrastructure (100% Complete)

The backend has been **fully separated** into a standalone Express.js server in the `backend/` folder.

#### Created Files:

```
backend/
├── .env                    ✅ Environment variables configured
├── .env.example            ✅ Template for environment setup
├── .gitignore              ✅ Git ignore for backend
├── package.json            ✅ Backend dependencies
├── tsconfig.json           ✅ TypeScript configuration
├── README.md               ✅ Backend documentation
└── src/
    ├── server.ts           ✅ Main Express server
    ├── config/
    │   └── mongodb.ts      ✅ Database connection
    ├── lib/
    │   └── cloudinary.ts   ✅ File upload utility
    ├── middleware/
    │   └── auth.ts         ✅ Authentication middleware
    ├── models/             ✅ All 6 Mongoose models
    │   ├── Admin.ts
    │   ├── Bill.ts
    │   ├── Employee.ts
    │   ├── Installment.ts
    │   ├── Payment.ts
    │   └── Vehicle.ts
    └── routes/             ✅ All 9 API routes converted
        ├── admins.ts       (5 endpoints)
        ├── auth.ts         (3 endpoints)
        ├── bills.ts        (5 endpoints)
        ├── employees.ts    (5 endpoints)
        ├── installments.ts (4 endpoints)
        ├── payments.ts     (5 endpoints)
        ├── reports.ts      (4 endpoints)
        ├── upload.ts       (1 endpoint)
        └── vehicles.ts     (5 endpoints)
```

#### Total API Endpoints Converted: **37 endpoints**

### ✅ Frontend Configuration

- Created `lib/api-config.ts` - API utility for backend communication
- Updated `.env.local` with `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5001`
- All necessary configuration in place

## What Still Needs to Be Done

### 🔄 Frontend API Calls Migration

The frontend still uses the old Next.js API routes. You need to update all fetch calls throughout the frontend to use the new backend.

#### Files That Need Updates:

All React components that make API calls need to be updated. These are typically in:
- `app/*/page.tsx` files
- `components/**/*.tsx` files

#### Pattern to Follow:

**Old (Next.js API routes):**
```typescript
const response = await fetch('/api/employees');
const data = await response.json();
```

**New (Separate backend):**
```typescript
import { apiRequest } from '@/lib/api-config';

const response = await apiRequest('/api/employees');
const data = await response.json();
```

#### Key Changes Needed:

1. Import the `apiRequest` helper from `@/lib/api-config`
2. Replace all `fetch()` calls with `apiRequest()`
3. The helper automatically:
   - Prefixes the backend URL
   - Includes credentials (cookies)
   - Sets proper headers

### 🗑️ Cleanup Old Files

After frontend migration is complete, remove these old Next.js API routes:

```bash
# These can be deleted once frontend is migrated:
rm -rf app/api/admins
rm -rf app/api/auth
rm -rf app/api/bills
rm -rf app/api/employees
rm -rf app/api/installments
rm -rf app/api/payments
rm -rf app/api/reports
rm -rf app/api/upload
rm -rf app/api/vehicles

# These backend files are no longer needed in frontend:
rm -rf models/
rm lib/mongodb.ts
rm lib/cloudinary.ts
rm middleware.ts  # Authentication now handled by backend
```

## How to Test

### 1. Start Backend Server

```bash
cd backend
npm install  # First time only
npm run dev
```

Backend will run on: `http://localhost:5001`

### 2. Start Frontend Server

```bash
# From root directory
npm run dev
```

Frontend will run on: `http://localhost:3000`

### 3. Test Flow

1. Open `http://localhost:3000`
2. Try to login
3. Once frontend API calls are updated, everything should work through the backend

## Benefits Achieved

✅ **Separation of Concerns**: Frontend and backend are now independent
✅ **Scalability**: Can scale backend separately from frontend
✅ **Multiple Clients**: Same API can serve web, mobile, or other apps
✅ **Better Organization**: Clear project structure
✅ **Independent Deployment**: Deploy frontend and backend to different services
✅ **Team Collaboration**: Backend and frontend teams can work independently

## Next Steps - Recommended Order

1. **Install backend dependencies and test**
   ```bash
   cd backend && npm install && npm run dev
   ```

2. **Verify backend is running**
   - Visit `http://localhost:5001/health`
   - Should return: `{"status":"ok","message":"Backend server is running"}`

3. **Update one frontend page as a test** (e.g., login page)
   - Update the login form to use `apiRequest`
   - Test that login works

4. **Gradually update all other pages**
   - Employees page
   - Vehicles page
   - Payments page
   - Bills page
   - Dashboard page
   - etc.

5. **Remove old API routes from frontend**
   - Delete `app/api/` directory
   - Delete `models/` directory
   - Clean up unused utilities

6. **Update middleware.ts**
   - Frontend middleware should only handle page redirects
   - Authentication is now handled by backend

## Important Notes

- **Cookies**: The backend uses httpOnly cookies for authentication. Make sure all API calls include `credentials: 'include'`
- **CORS**: Backend is configured to accept requests from `http://localhost:3000`. Update `FRONTEND_URL` in backend `.env` for production
- **Environment Variables**: Backend runs on port 5001, frontend on port 3000
- **Database**: Both were using the same MongoDB - backend continues to use it

**Status**: Backend is 100% ready. Frontend just needs to be updated to use the new API.
